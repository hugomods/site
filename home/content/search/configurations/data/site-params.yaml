  default: false

- name: min_match_char_length
  type: number
  desc: Only the matches whose length exceeds this value will be returned. (For instance, if you want to ignore single character matches in the result, set it to `2`).

- name: location
  type: number
  desc: Determines approximately where in the text is the pattern expected to be found.
  default: 0

- name: threshold
  type: number

- name: distance
  type: number
  desc: Determines how close the match must be to the fuzzy location (specified by location). An exact letter match which is distance characters away from the fuzzy location would score as a complete mismatch. A distance of 0 requires the match be at the exact location specified. A distance of `1000` would require a perfect match to be within `800` characters of the location to be found using a threshold of `0.8`.
  default: 100
