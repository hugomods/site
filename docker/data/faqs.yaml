- title: When to use non-root images?
  show: true
  content: |
    - Prioritize the non-root images as your primary option, unless it doesn't meet the environmental requirements, such as running non-root in Podman rootless mode may cause permission issues.
    - Local development, since we typically do not operate the system as the root user, as using a root image may lead to security issues and permission issues.
      For example, you probably can not manage the files generated by the root container without granting permissions by default.
