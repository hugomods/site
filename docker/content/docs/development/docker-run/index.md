Firstly, you'll need to choose the proper [image tag]({{< relref "docs/tags" >}}) for your themes and sites, in this section, we take `hugomods/hugo:exts` as the example.

## Change Current Working Directory

Change current working directory to your project root.

{{< page-resource-content "codes/cd" >}}

{{% bs/alert warning %}}
The rest of steps are performed under your project root.
{{% /bs/alert %}}

## Install Dependencies (Optional)

{{% bs/alert info %}}
Skip this step if your site/theme doesnâ€™t require it.
{{% /bs/alert %}}

You may want to install the dependencies before running Hugo server, such as install dependencies via npm.

{{< page-resource-content "codes/npm" >}}

1. `-v ${PWD}:/src` mounts current working directory on the [default working directory]({{< relref "docs/introduction#default-working-directory" >}})(`/src`) inside the Docker container.
1. `$HOME/hugo_cache:/tmp/hugo_cache` mounts `$HOME/hugo_cache` on the default `cacheDir` (`/tmp/hugo_cache`) to improve build performance.
1. `npm i` replaces the [default command]({{< relref "docs/introduction#default-command" >}})(`hugo version`), which is the shorthand of `npm install`.

## Start Hugo Server

{{< page-resource-content "codes/hugo-server" >}}

{{% bs/alert danger %}}
Please note that `--bind 0.0.0.0` is required, otherwise Hugo server may not receive any incoming requests from host.
{{% /bs/alert %}}

{{% bs/alert info %}}
Since `0.128.0`, `server` is available as an alias of `hugo server`, which will bind `0.0.0.0` by default.
{{% /bs/alert %}}

1. `-p port:port` mapping from host machine port to container port.

Using another port than `1313`, such as `8080`.
